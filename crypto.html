                            <p>What is cryptocurrency?
                                Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that does not rely on banks to validate transactions. It's a peer-to-peer system that allows anyone, anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of physical money being carried and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments simply exist as digital entries in online databases describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transaction is recorded on a public ledger. Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets.
                                
                                Cryptocurrencies got their name because they use cryptography to verify transactions. This means advanced coding is required when storing and transferring cryptocurrency data between wallets and on public ledgers. The purpose of cryptography is to provide security and protection.
                                
                                The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created in 2009 and still the most popular to this day. Much of the interest in cryptocurrencies is trading for profit, and speculators can drive prices up.
                                How does
                                cryptocurrency work?
                                's cryptocurrency runs on a distributed public ledger called a blockchain. This is a record of all transactions updated and maintained by the currency holder.
                                
                                units of cryptocurrency are created through a process called mining. Mining uses computer power to solve complex math problems to generate coins. Users can also buy currencies from brokers and store and spend them using crypto wallets.
                                
                                When you own cryptocurrency, you don't own anything tangible. What you have is the key that allows you to send records or units of measurement from one person to another without a trusted third party.
                                
                                Bitcoin has been around since 2009, but the application of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is still increasing in the financial field, and more applications are expected in the future. Trading such as bonds, stocks and other financial assets will eventually be able to be traded using this technology.
                                
                                Examples of Virtual Currencies
                                There are thousands of virtual currencies.
                                
                                
                                Bitcoin:
                                
                                
                                Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency created in 2009 and is still the most traded. This currency was developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is widely believed to be a pseudonym for an individual or group whose exact identity is unknown.
                                
                                Ethereum:
                                
                                
                                Ethereum is a blockchain platform that was developed in 2015 and has its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum. It is the second most popular virtual currency after Bitcoin.
                                
                                Litecoin:
                                
                                This currency is most similar to Bitcoin but is accelerating to accommodate new innovations such as faster payments and processes that allow for more transactions.
                                
                                Ripple:
                                
                                Ripple is a distributed ledger system founded in 2012. Ripple can be used to track many types of transactions, not just cryptocurrencies. The company behind it has worked with various banks and financial institutions.
                                
                                Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are collectively called "altcoins" to distinguish them from the originals.</p>
